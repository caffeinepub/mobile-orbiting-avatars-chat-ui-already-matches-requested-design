# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Join button in WaitlistCTA component to redirect users to a Google Form instead of showing a "coming soon" alert.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the "coming soon" alert from the Join button click handler
- Add redirect functionality to open https://forms.gle/nD95mzMCvfRbBFZV7 in a new tab when the Join button is clicked

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the Join button to immediately access the waitlist Google Form in a new tab, allowing them to sign up for the service.
